## This script is for scoring Bridge contracts in 3 possible ways:
##  v0 - original IMP, see https://tinyurl.com/ydcwepa9
##  v1 - original IMP with slam bonus updated to reflect real Bridge games
##  v2 - see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_scoring (single table)
##  v3 - simplification - remove points for overtricks
